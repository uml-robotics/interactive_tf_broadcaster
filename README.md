==========================

Use rviz interactive marker to adjust published transform.

It is publishing /map -> /base_link transform. If you want anything else, the code needs to be edited. Or feel free to add parameters.

The code has been written for another project and this repository is created by splitting the original one. Also, as can be noted, the code is based on one of rviz interactive marker's tutorial files.
I am putting it out AS IS.
